title: How to know if the window state has changed to maximized in WPF

  In this post we will see how we can identify if the application has been

### Introduction
In this post we will see how we can identify if the application has been maximized or it is restored to normal state. We will use the Resize event equivalent in WPF which is SizeChanged event. We will subscribe to this event and will check the window state to identify if the window has been maximized or it is restored to normal.

{% highlight csharp %}
Application.Current.MainWindow.SizeChanged += WindowSizeChanged;
private void WindowSizeChanged(object sender, SizeChangedEventArgs e)
{
    this.HandleWindowState();
}
 
private void HandleWindowState()
{
    WindowState windowState = Application.Current.MainWindow.WindowState;
    if (windowState == WindowState.Maximized)
     {                    
     }
    else if (windowState == WindowState.Normal)
     {                    
     }            
}
{% endhighlight %}

And letâ€™s not forget to clean it by unsubscribing to the SizeChanged event by
{% highlight csharp %}
Application.Current.MainWindow.SizeChanged -= WindowSizeChanged;
{% endhighlight %}
